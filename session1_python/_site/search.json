    "text": "Coding is fun!!!\n\n\nIn this part of the course we will leverage the following resources:\n\nIntro to Python book\n\n\n\n\nWarning: package 'countdown' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\n−+\n05:00\n\n\n\n\n\nPython is amazingly complex and powerful. It is also very picky about the syntax you use to communicate with it. However, Python is not intelligent. You are really just having a conversation with yourself, but using proper syntax. Python is a way for the creators of programs to express how the conversation is supposed to proceed.\nProgramming languages like Python need to be translated. There are two types of “translator”: (1) interpreters and (2) compilers.\nAn interpreter reads the source code of the program as written by the programmer, parses the source code, and interprets the instructions on the fly. Python is an interpreter and when we are running Python interactively (like in this notebook), we can type a line of Python (a sentence) and Python processes it immediately and is ready for us to type another line of Python.\nA compiler needs to be handed the entire program in a file, and then it runs a process to translate the high-level source code into machine language and then the compiler puts the resulting machine language into a file for later execution.\nUnlike human languages, the Python vocabulary is actually pretty small. We call this “vocabulary” the “reserved words”. These are words that have very special meaning to Python. When Python sees these words in a Python program, they have one and only one meaning to Python.\nThe reserved words in the language where humans talk to Python include the following:\nand       del       global      not       with\nas        elif      if          or        yield\nassert    else      import      pass\nbreak     except    in          raise\nclass     finally   is          return\ncontinue  for       lambda      try\ndef       from      nonlocal    while\nYou will learn some fo these words later in the course. For now, remember to not use them as variable or function names.\nDuring this course you will learn how to write and execute your function but also how to use Python’s built-in functions. Python has many built-in functions that are always ready to use. The first one you should learn is help(). You can use it any time you need to refresh your memory on how a particular function works. Type it in the line below and run (ask the instructor how to run a piece of code if you are not sure).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, you opened an interactive help. You can type name of any function, module, etc. Until you type “quit”, the help prompt will remain active, allowing you to ask more question. Yet, it will block all the other lines from running. Now ask help about print() function (type “print” in the help prompt). Then close the help prompt (type “quit” in the help prompt).\nNow, once you know how the print function works, tell Python to print Hello world! (as every true programmer should do ;-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the lines in Python tell Python that you want it to remember some value for later. They do not give any visible output. Pick a name for that value to be remembered. We use the term variable to refer to the labels we use to refer to this stored data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use that variable to retrieve the value later. Instead of typing print(10) you can type print([vairbale name]) (where [variable name] is the name you chose earlier)\nTry the print the value assigned to x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny value can be assigned to a variable. Variables can be also used in longer expressions or assigned to other variables (see the example below). Later you will see when it becomes useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s print y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater, we will talk more about the variables.\n\n\nTyping commands into the Python interpreter is a great way to experiment with Python’s features, but it is not recommended for solving more complex problems.\nNormally, when we want to write a program, we use a text editor to write the Python instructions into a file, which is called a script. By convention, Python scripts have names that end with .py.\nTo execute the script, you have to tell the Python interpreter the name of the file. Let’s say we have a file called python.py. In a command window (or terminal), you would run a file as follows:\n$ python python.py\nWe use a special type of Python called iPython. In iPython we can use special notebooks (like the one you are reading now), which let us mix formatted text and Python code and execute Python code directly in the notebook.\nIf you want to install Python locally on your computer, check out one of these links: Windows Mac\n\n\n\nThe definition of a program at its most basic is a sequence of Python statements that have been crafted to do something.\nFor example, look at the following text. Look at the text and figure out the most common word and how many times it occurs.\nit may help to understand human affairs to be clear that most of the great triumphs and tragedies of history are caused, not by people being fundamentally good or fundamentally bad, but by people being fundamentally people ... he rather liked people\nThen imagine that you are doing this task looking at millions of lines of text. It would be quicker for you to learn Python and write a Python program to count the words than it would be to manually scan the words.\nNow take a look at the code below and run it.

You assign a value to a variable using = sign:\n[variable] = [value]\nAssign 3.1415926535897931 to variable pi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can assign value of any type to a variable.\nAssign 'Python ROCKS!!!' to a variable called message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that assignement to a variable does not produce any output. You can print the value assigned to a variable by passing variable name to the print() function.\nAttention!! You pass the variable name without the quotation marks. That’s how we can tell variables from strings.\nPrint message\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint pi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can check the type of the values by simply checking the type of a variable. Check the type of pi and message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you noticed that the type of a variable is in fact the type of the assigned value?"

    "text": "Statements\nYou have just learned the second type of statments.\nA statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two kinds of statements: print being an expression statement and assignment.\nWhen you type a statement in interactive mode, the interpreter executes it and displays the result, if there is one. A script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute.\nRun the following code and compare it with its output:"

Instead it performs concatenation, which means joining the strings by linking them end to end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe * operator also works with strings by multiplying the content of a string by an integer."

    "text": "User input\nPython provides a built-in function called input that gets input from the keyboard. When this function is called, the program stops and waits for the user to type something. When the user presses Return or Enter, the program resumes and input returns what the user typed as a string.\nTry it yourself:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo print the value entered by the user, you simply print the variable it was assigned to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can pass a string to input to be displayed to the user before pausing for input:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sequence \\n at the end of the prompt represents a newline, which is a special character that causes a line break. That’s why the user’s input appears below the prompt.\nNow you can print your name:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can try it yourself.\n\nAsk your user to type the number of books s/he read last month.\nAssign the value to number variable\nTransform number variable to an integer using int() (use help() if you need it)\nCalculate the difference between the user and an average person (an average person reads 1 book a month)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttention!!!\nIf you expect the user to type a numeric value and the user types something other than a string of digits, you get an error (try to type the answer as a string, e.g. six instead of 6). Why does it happen?\nLater, we will learn how to deal with such cases."

    "text": "Comments\nAs programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing. These notes are called comments, and in Python they start with the # symbol:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything from the # to the end of the line is ignored; it has no effect on the program.\n\n\n\nOn completing your first Python class!\n\n\n\n\nImages and GIFs Disclaimer: Some of the images and GIFs used on this website are not owned by me.
